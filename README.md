# Electricity Bill Management System
This is a mini project as a part of the course "Database Management System" in 4th semester of B.Tech. This project is build using Whiptail and Shell Scripting. (Cause everyone in my class was using Python, Java, JS and I wanted to be different ðŸ˜‚)

## My fellow juniors
If you want this project for your college assignment, feel free to use it. But please don't just copy paste it. Try to understand the queries (professors will ask) if you want report or ppt its in this repo. just make sure to edit the basics like college name, your name etc.

## How to run this project?
Note: You need Linux to run this project.(Its better than Bindoge, trust me)

### Mysql
1. Create a database named `dbms`(or any name you want) in mysql.
2. Run the `dbms.sql` file in the database. (Or copy the create table queries in the file)

### Shell Script
1. on the top of the file `FRONTEND.sh`, change the `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_NAME` to your mysql username, password and database name.
